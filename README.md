# Software-Architecture-and-Design
E-Commerce website with database.
This project is designed with MVC and multi-tier architecture. SOLID rules were tried to be followed as much as possible. The diagrams are also included in the repository. 
SQL 2019 was used as the database.
Tables were created with Code first approach.
ConnectionString is in /PEPPI/WebConfig.
I could not spend enough time on the frontend part, I will continue to update.
